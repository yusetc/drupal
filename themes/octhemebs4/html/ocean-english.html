<blockquote>
<p>“The value of Ocean is multifold. Particularly with new patients, I find the tablet is a very easy and comfortable format for them to answer questions about their symptoms in a private setting, while I’m seeing another patient. The result is an honest, comprehensive history. Since Ocean generates a clinical note, I can read it before seeing the patient, instead of typing their answers in the EMR during the visit. Not only does Ocean help manage my time efficiently – it also improves the patient experience and reduces wasted time in the waiting room.”</p>
