    <h2>Clinical vital signs</h2>
    <p><strong>High Tech Meets High Touch</strong></p>
    <p>Cloud DX Connected Health devices are purpose built to record precision blood pressure, weight, oxygen, and temperature right in the exam room. Practitioners can gather high quality data automatically, potentially saving hundreds of hours of staff time over the course of a year.</p>

  <h2>Precision results. Smart notifications.</h2>
  <p>If the doctor prescribes a Connected Health Kit for remote home monitoring then identical, calibrated, accurate results from home also appear in the patient record automatically. Smart ‘Notifications’* only generate an alert if a significant event occurs. Cloud DX’s unique <a href="https://www.clouddx.com/#pulsewavedevice#tas">Total Anomaly Score</a>  detects a suspected heart anomaly, and automatically flags the result for further investigation. Cloud Connected Health delivers identical results in the clinic and at home, improving outcomes, saving time & money. </p>

<h2>Outstanding accuracy</h2>
<p>When it comes to accuracy, Pulsewave leads the field. In 2015 a rigorous third-party clinical study at the New Brunswick Heart Centre in Saint John NB compared Pulsewave results against an invasive surgical catheter, and found that the Pulsewave wrist cuff and Cloud Diagnostics algorithms could non-invasively measure blood pressure at the level of the ascending aorta with clinical accuracy. </p>
